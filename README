# Smart Sustainable Stadium – Arduino Prototype

## 📌 Idea Overview
This project demonstrates a prototype for an energy-generating smart stadium using Arduino technology. It focuses on converting kinetic and sound energy into usable electrical energy inside sports facilities.

## ⚙️ What This Code Does
The Arduino sketch reads input from:
- Pressure sensors on smart floor tiles (representing audience movement)
- Sound sensors capturing crowd noise
- Optional: Vibration sensors simulating ball movement

It processes the signals and simulates energy generation based on input intensity.

## 🔧 Tools and Components
- Arduino Uno
- Pressure sensors
- Sound sensor module
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- LED or display to indicate generated energy (simulated)

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Connect components as shown in the circuit diagram (to be added).
2. Upload `.ino` file to Arduino board using Arduino IDE.
3. Move or clap near the sensors to simulate input and observe LED or serial output.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time dashboards
- Energy storage simulation
- Integration with AI for optimization
